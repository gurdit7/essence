That's why I started looking for professional guidance and ended up at essence. <br/><br/> I immediately felt at ease and Leon's enthusiasm was infectious.

For many people, running a marathon is an incredible feat and sometimes I still can't believe I did it.

Initially I trained with Leon once a week. Although I certainly didn't get the enthusiastic and positive feeling in the beginning that I do with running, I did notice results. But the lot of running also meant that this result was minimal for me and I was not very satisfied with it. That's why I started training twice a week under the guidance of Leon. He teaches me how to train the right way, knows how to motivate me and has even managed to get me to enjoy strength training! I also benefit greatly from my strength training while running. I have become stronger and my back is less likely to hurt.      <br/>       <br/>         <strong>Blast!</strong><br/>         Exercising clears my head and gives me a lot of energy. I usually train once in the evening and on Friday morning at 8:00 am.

This has gradually changed in 2 years. Where time used to be my biggest enemy, I currently plan my private and work appointments around exercise. This 'lifestyle changing' arose spontaneously during Leon's training. Ultimately, I was inspired by wanting to feel stronger and fitter every week.<br/><br/>  Every week I want to make progress by keeping track of all my training.

My body has completely changed. I now have control in my own hands to make something beautiful out of it. Not only has my body changed, but mentally I have also become a lot stronger and have fewer health problems. Damn, why did I find that out so late! <br/><br/> Cheers,<br/> Sander Rohrink",
